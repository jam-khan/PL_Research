<!-- Why is Formal Verification of Quantum Programs important? -->
Destructive nature of quantum measurement.

2.1 Hybrid Computational Model
2.1.1 Hybrid Circuit Model

Classical Controller with Quantum Coprocessor which holds
a quantum memory. Classical part applies a fixed set of
elementary operations (buffered as quantum circuits) to
update and query (measure) the quantum memory.

2.1.4 Quantum Circuits
1. initialization phase
    Create a Quantum Register in one of the basis states.
    In case of qubit-register, then one of the bell's basis
    |00>, |01>, |10>, |11>
